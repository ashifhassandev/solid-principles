## 📘 Overview

The notes cover:

- **S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
  A class should have only one reason to change.

- **O — Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
  Software should be open for extension but closed for modification.

- **L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
  Subtypes must be replaceable by their base types without breaking functionality.

- **I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
  Clients should not depend on methods they do not use.

- **D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
  High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not on low-level modules.

## 🧠 Purpose

This note provides a **clean, example-driven explanation** of SOLID principles with TypeScript/JavaScript code snippets, showing how they help build:

- Scalable and maintainable systems  
- Modular and testable codebases  
- Framework-agnostic architectures
